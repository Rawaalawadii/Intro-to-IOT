# Agenda 

In the First Week the Students will have clear overview on Basics and Bulid a First Project. 

Objective

To Introduce IOT and Provied an insight into new possibilities  and challenges with IOT. 


| Days   | Topics  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Day 1 | [Whats IOT ? - History of IOT - New Possibilities - Exsample of IOT APPlication](https://github.com/Rawaalawadii/Introduction-to-IOT/blob/main/README.md)  |
| Day 2 |  [Digital Logic  - Elements of IOT - simulation SBC](https://github.com/Rawaalawadii/Introduction-to-IOT/blob/main/README.md) |
| Day 3 |  [Review HW - simulation with Cisco Packet tracer ](https://github.com/Rawaalawadii/Review-HW---simulation-CiscoPackettracer-) |
| Day 4 |  Review - Praper for Fainl Bisics project |
| Last day  | [Project](https://github.com/Rawaalawadii/Project-weekone-/blob/main/README.md)  |



Project 


Bulid a simple project for Handling :
- Ardouo simulation. 
- IOT Element simulation.


```

int led = 7; 

void setup()
{
  pinMode(led,OUTPUT );
}

void loop()
{
  digitalWrite(led, HIGH);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
  digitalWrite(led, LOW);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
}

```

Secondly Project building Simple IOT system . 

Idea : 

opening the garage of the house through SBC programming is that if he presses the Push button, the garage door opens . 

IOT elemnts used : 

- push button 
- SBC
- Door




summary

- The Internet of Things (IoT) connects all objects to the Internet.
- Devices can communicate with each other and with the cloud.
- This will lead to innovative applications. 
- Introduction to digital logic
- Signals
- Types of signals 




The second week 

In Secound Week the Students will have a Introduction in Network and DataCenter.  

Objective 
To Present a new Introduction in Network and DataCenter

| Last day  | [Projects](https://github.com/Rawaalawadii/Project-weektwo/edit/main/README.md)  |


Project

Networks 

1- send Pin to tow Pcs 
2- link two network through Routers 

Network Design 

-  Buliding a Design  for link two Buliding 

IOT 

- Buliding alarm system 


summary

 - what is the network. 
 - what is DC.  
 - what is the technology used in DC Room. 
 - What IOt and Networks 



the third week 

In Third Week the Students will have a IOT System Architecture and Network Design.  

Objective 
To Present a new IOT System Architecture and Network Design
